        <Description>1 patient. 1 insplan, 6 benefits: 1000 annual max, 100% preventive, 100% diagnostic, $50 deduct general, $25 deduct preventive, and $25 deduct diagnostic. One TP procedure for $60, code D0120 (perExam). Second TP procedure for $70, code D1110 (prophy). Second procedure should show no deductible. This is because we need to treat the $25 deductible as a single deductible that applies to preventive/diagnostic. It's not two deductibles. This is only a temporary solution, and the better solution will be to support code ranges that include both preventive and diagnostic, and then to enter a single $25 deductible for that range.</Description>

The patient has one insurance plan, category percentage, subscriber self. Benefits: annual max $1300, 50% coverage on crowns, and a $25 general deductible. Both TP procs are crowns, first TP proc is D2790  for $800 on #1 with priority 1, second TP proc is D2790 on #9 for $800 with priority 2. First, the estimates are pre-calculated by visiting the TP module. Then, when opening a procedure from Chart Module, followed by opening the claimproc from inside of the Edit Procedure window, the amounts must match those listed in the table above.

        <Description>The patient has one insurance plan with general deductible of $50, 100% coverage on Diagnostic, and a $10 xray deductible. We treatment plan the patient for a cleaning (D0110) and an xray (D0220). The cleaning is estimated to take up $40 of the patient's deductible and the xray is estimated to take up $10 of the patient's deductible. We mark the cleaning complete and leave the xray treatment planned. A claim for the cleaning is submitted, and the deductible comes out to $50. This means that, even though the patient has a $10 xray deductible,they have already hit their max deductible for the year and should owe nothing. The xray deductible estimate is $0.</Description>

        <Description>The patient has one insurance plan with general deductible of $100, 100% coverage on Diagnostic, and a $50 xray deductible. We treatment plan the patient for two xrays (D0330 and D0220). The estimate is calculated and shows that we expect the patient to pay $25 for one xray and $25 for another, hitting their xray deductible. We set one xray complete and create a claim which will require  the patient pay their max xray deductible of $50. Finally, we treatment plan a cleaning procedure, complete it, and submit a claim. The deductible comes out to $50. This means that this $50 that went towards their xray deductible also goes towards their general deductible. XRay: &#x09; $50 deductible&#x09;&#x09;-&#x09; $50 patient portion paid &#x09; = &#x09; $0 owed for patient's other xray General:&#x09; $100 deductible &#x09;-&#x09; $50 xray deductible met &#x09; = &#x09; $50 owed for the patient's general deductible</Description>

        <Description>Patient has a 'Patient Payment Plan' for $100 with 20% APR and an amortization schedule composed of 10 payments of which the first month of charges will be due today. All payment plan charges are attached to a procedure that is worth $200. The first month of payment plan charges due will be $10.94 of which $9.27 is principal and $1.67 is interest. The patient will make a payment of $30.94 which overpays the current amount due by $20. The payment will be made with two payment splits, one for the $9.27 in principal and one for $21.67 in interest. Running an income transfer after creating the payment should move the $20 of overpaid interest to unearned and then from unearned directly to the procedure because the payment plan does not cover the entire procedure amount.</Description>

        <Description>When a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan, with attached production, payments can be made Explicitly or Implicitly linked to either one or both. In the event that the user wishes to create offsetting payments that do not Explicitly link to production, we want to be certain the Dynamic Payment Plan is not overpaid. We also do not want to allow money to be taken directly from production. If a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan for Patient Joe, giving the plan a 5 APR and a Procedure with a total cost of $100, they may choose to pay the first payment's principal first using the following Paysplits:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Patient</b></td>

		<td><b>Procedure</b></td>
		<td><b>Amt Paid</b></td>

This can cause the Dynamic Payment Plan to be considered overpaid since we are Explicitly adding money to it and the attached production but Implicitly removing money from the plan itself. OpenDental should see these splits and calculate that two of them are intended offsets which should net to 0. The resulting Account Entries should look like:<br/>

        <Description>When a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan, with attached production, payments can be made Explicitly or Implicitly linked to either one or both. In the event that the user wishes to create offsetting payments that do not Explicitly link to production, we want to be certain the Dynamic Payment Plan is not overpaid. We also do not want to allow money to be taken directly from production. If a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan for Patient Joe, giving the plan a 5 APR and a Procedure with a total cost of $100, they may choose to pay the first payment's principal first using the following Paysplits:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Patient</b></td>
		<td><b>PayPlan</b></td>
		<td><b>Procedure</b></td>
		<td><b>Amt Paid</b></td>
		<td><b>PayPlanChargeType</b></td>
		<td><b>Notes</b></td>

		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>99.58</td>
		<td>Principal</td>
		<td>Payment on Payplan</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>99.58</td>
		<td>Unknown</td>
		<td>Income Transfer on Payplan with Procedure attached</td>

		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>-99.58</td>
		<td>Unknown</td>
		<td>Income Transfer on Payplan without Procedure attached</td>
	</tr>
</table>
This can cause the Dynamic Payment Plan to be considered overpaid since we are Explicitly adding money to it and the attached production but Implicitly removing money from the plan itself. OpenDental should see these splits and calculate that two of them are intended offsets which should net to 0. The resulting Account Entries should look like:<br/>
